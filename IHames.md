#Isaiah Hames

## About Me
My name is Isaiah Hames and I am a 3rd year Computer Science Major at UNCG. My favorite color is Blue. I enjoy going to the gym and playing video games in my spare time.

## My CSC340 Goals
A goal of mine for CSC340 is to put my java knowledge to actual use. Also to learn how to build functional apps with java. I want to expand my knowledge of Git and have real-time use of it.
